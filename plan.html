<h2>Goals</h2>
<p>Townsville Community Music Centre, abbreviated as TCMC, organizes workshops and events      like concert throughout the year from the multitude of genres. So, the primary goal of      TCMC is to reccruit new members and increase the invlovement of members in the              volunteering and promotional activities like promoting concerts, workshops, volunteering    for administration. Also, TCMC has to focus on ticket sales of concerts, rope in more        events from the performers and also do photo shoot, media releases for the promotion        campaign.<br>In nut shell, TCMC primarily focusses on the organization of events,            workshops, concerts, promotional activities, ticket sales and the like.</p>

<h2>Target Audience</h2>
<p>As TCMC focusses on musical events from the diverse genres like classical, jazz, ethnic music to name a few, so obviously the target audience are from the different walks of life having variety tastes in music. The target audience can be of the variety age groups from young to old. So, TCMC must emphasis on providing distinctive themes on every events. Keeping in mind the audience type, the site must be developed appealing and attracting people of every age group.</p>

<h2>Success Evaluation</h2>
<p> The site for TCMC is being developed keeping in mind the goals of TCMC and target audience. So, the success can be determined by asking the questions like: "What is the age group of audience?", "What type of people have applied for membership?", "What is the ratio of ticket sales for different sorts of music?". Suppose, if one particular age group dominates as audience, then it means that some tweaks are needed so as to attract people of other age group also. So, if the answers to the aforementioned questions is not satisfactory, then we need to tweak the website to fix the issue.</p>
