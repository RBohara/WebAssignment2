                        The Townsville Community Centre began in early 1983 when a group of people with a shared interest in musical matters decided to address the local paucity in musical opportunities. An early objective of the centre was to encourage the establishment of tertiary music education in Townsville, and provide classes, courses, and workshops in a variety of musical styles, levels, instruments and experiences.

                    <p>The Centre ran a significant concert program for many years and promoted emerging musicians. Reflecting the Centre's increasing workload as an information and referral service, this collection includes documents on concerts, training, instruments, musicians, sheet music, performance and rehearsal spaces, functions and events, sources for grants and funding, legal matters, continuing professional development of local musicians, and integrating overseas professional musicians with local community musicians.</p>

                 <h1>A brief look into the history by Jean Dartnall</h1>
                  <p>1983:</p>
                  <p>Establishment of the Townsville Community Music Centre on May 24th.</p><br/>
                  
                  <p>1984:</p>
                  <p>Mira Henderson (Acting Director), the first staff member, instigated a series of classes starting in 1984 using the skills of people living in Townsville to enhance and encourage music learners of all ages.</p><br/>
                  
                  <p>1985:</p>
                  <p>Kirsty Veron, first Director (1983-1988), worked with Mira in the 1983 classes.</p><br/>
                  
                  <p>1985:</p>
                  <p>The Music Centre produced Benjamin Britten's Noyes Fludde in St James Anglican Cathedral which involved hundreds of children and some of Townsville's best known (and loved) musicians. Produced by Rachel Berker (now Rachel Matthews) and involved Bernie Lannigan and Sandra Voss in the main parts rehearsed by Bill Williams; Donna McMahon and Jenny Carr rehearsing the strings and recorders and guest conductor Donald Hollier.</p><br/>
                  
                  <p>1987:</p>
                  <p>This was the year of the first fund raising dinner. These dinners became a tradition as they were a wonderful mixture of good food, good wine and good music. The first ones were held at the home of Paul and June Tonnoir in North Ward. Later they moved to the Bishop's Lodge as guests of the Anglican Bishop. Attendees would often book their tickets for the next year's dinner as soon as they had attended this one. They ran until 2004.</p><br/>
                 
                  <p>1988:</p>
                  <p>Mary Lou Schoenfeldt was appointed as Administrator. Although this was initially a small part time job with limited responsibilities, Mary Lou made the job, the Centre and indeed music in Townsville, her own. She was a wonderful asset to the Centre and to the cultural life of the City until she had to retire due to ill health in 2003.</p><br />
                  
                  <p>1990:</p>
                  <p>This year the first lunchtime concert was held at the PercTucker Gallery. The importance of providing performance opportunities for emerging musicians had become evident and from this time, for a number of years, one of the major activities of the Centre was the production and management of concerts.</p><br />
                  
                  <p>1999:</p>
                  <p>Arts Queensland had been a major funder of Music Centre activities for a number of years but in this year they agreed to provide funding on a three year basis.
                  </p><br/>
                  
                  <p>2003:<br /></p>
                  <p>A spectacular variety concert was held at the Townsville Civic Theatre to celebrate twenty years of the Music Centre and as a tribute to Mary Lou.</p><br />
                  
                  <p>2005:<br /></p>
                  <p>The Centre moved to offices in the Old Magistrate's Court.</p><br />
                  
                 
                  <p>2012:<br /></p>
                  <p>The Centre moved to its present office in the Townsville Civic Theatre building.</p><br />
